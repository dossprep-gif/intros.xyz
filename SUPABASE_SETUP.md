# Supabase Setup Guide for intros.xyz

## üöÄ Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Create Supabase Project
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Sign up/Login to your account
3. Click "New Project"
4. Choose your organization
5. Enter project details:
   - **Name**: `intros-xyz`
   - **Database Password**: Generate a strong password (save it!)
   - **Region**: Choose closest to your users
6. Click "Create new project"
7. Wait for project to be ready (2-3 minutes)

### 2. Get Your Credentials
1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **API** in your Supabase dashboard
2. Copy these values:
   - **Project URL** (starts with `https://`)
   - **anon/public key** (long string starting with `eyJ`)

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables
1. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```

2. Edit `.env.local` with your actual values:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
   ```

### 4. Set Up Database Schema
1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Copy the entire contents of `supabase-schema.sql`
3. Paste it into the SQL editor
4. Click **Run** to execute the schema

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** If you already have the basic schema set up, you only need to run the new parts for the friends system. The updated schema includes:
- New `friends` table
- Additional RLS policies for friends
- Updated user policies to allow profile viewing

### 5. Configure Authentication
1. Go to **Authentication** ‚Üí **Settings** in Supabase dashboard
2. Under **General Settings**:
   - Enable **Enable email confirmations** (optional for development)
   - Set **Site URL** to `http://localhost:3000` (for development)
3. Under **Email Templates**, you can customize the signup/forgot password emails

### 6. Set Up Storage (Profile Pictures)
1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Storage**
2. The `profile-pictures` bucket should be automatically created by the schema
3. If you see "Bucket not found" errors, manually create the bucket:
   - Click **"New bucket"**
   - **Name**: `profile-pictures`
   - **Public**: ‚úÖ (checked)
   - **File size limit**: 5MB
   - **Allowed MIME types**: `image/jpeg, image/png, image/gif, image/webp`
4. The storage policies are automatically configured by the schema
5. If you still have issues, run the SQL schema again to ensure all policies are created

### 7. Test the Integration
1. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
3. Try signing up with a new account
4. Check your Supabase dashboard to see the user created
5. Test uploading a profile picture in the edit profile page

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"Invalid API key"**
- Check your `.env.local` file has the correct values
- Ensure no extra spaces or quotes around the values

**"User not found"**
- Check if the database schema was created successfully
- Verify the trigger function for new user creation

**"Permission denied"**
- Check Row Level Security policies are enabled
- Verify the user is properly authenticated

**"Bucket not found"**
- Go to Storage in your Supabase dashboard
- Create the `profile-pictures` bucket manually if it doesn't exist
- Ensure the bucket is set to public
- Re-run the SQL schema to create storage policies

**"Invalid user data"**
- This usually means the profile picture URL validation failed

### Getting Help:
- Check Supabase logs in the dashboard
- Review browser console for client-side errors
- Ensure all environment variables are set correctly
